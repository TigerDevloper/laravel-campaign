When I want to add a channel, I should be able to indicate stage of campaign Tease, Live, Sustain or ALL

I should also be able to automatically pull the channele's message from the one that I have defined in row 30 to 34 or create my own.

When Defining campaign. You can always go back and add more sub messages to a campaign.
Need to add stage to be used Tease, Live, Sustain or ALL
I can remove all colour coding and keep everything just white.

Exporting and Filtering  is very import for app - I should be able to switch view to what is in Sheet 2 - Same content but filtered and presented differently. 

So I can filter the spreadsheet by Channel (See Sheet 1) or by Message (See Sheet 2)


You mean, when adding sub messages to a campaign, you should define its stage to be used as well?   = Yes = Tease, Live, Sustain or ALL

Where can you remove all color coding?   = Make everything I export in Excel plain white - Orange, Blue, Purple e.tc

Are you okay with the page layout?  >> This is the most important part of the app, needs to flow and be super easy to use - Please see this https://freedcamp.com/register/account_settings

And what is message guide? >> After you enter Message. Message guide is optional, just to add more information about what is happening at this stage
